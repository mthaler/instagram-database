## Install PostgreSQL

On Debian Linux, PostgreSQL can be installed with the following command:

```bash
# apt-get install postgresql postgresql-doc
```

Both the default database user and default database are called postgres

## Create a user and database for the system user

By default, Postgres uses a concept called “roles” to handle authentication and authorization.
After installation Postgres is set up to use ident authentication, meaning that it associates Postgres roles with a matching Unix/Linux system account.

Use su to swith to the postgres acount and create a user with the same name as the system user:

```
$ su -
# su -s /bin/bash postgres
postgres@debian:/root$ createuser -s username
```
The -s option grants superuser privileges.

Next we need to create a database for the user:

```bash
postgres@debian:/root$ createdb -O username
```

Now try to start psql as a normal user:

```bash
$ psql
#username=# \q
```
